                Hi, Iâ€™m Paradise.
                Student of the University of Port Harcourt, and A Port Harcourt makeup artist.
                I started Makeup as a skill but now it is a hobby for me I love everything about makeup the process the finish stage and the happiness I always leave on a client's face.
                I See Makeup beyond the regular thing we do, I see it as art.

                Paradisegloss_n_glam Started November 20th, 
                2020 when I was on Instagram going through some 
                artwork then I came to the conclusion why not start 
                up a makeup business since I love colors and art so much.
                Well, Paradisegloss_n_glam is just a little business, for now, 
                I work mostly with my client and some photographers to create amazing works.
